This repository contains the result of my master thesis: my implementation of
symbolic *matrix calculus*, in particular the the special case of functions of
matrix input and scalar output.

To understand why this family of functions is important consider the following
expression *G:F(X)* where *G* and *X* are matrices, *F* a function of matrix
value and *:* the Frobenius inner product. The derivative of that espression is
the "vector-Jacobian" needed by the back-propagation algorithm to make
the "gradient" pass through that function.

The matrix calculus used is the one by Magnus and Naudecker in "Matrix
Diï¬€erential Calculus with Applications in Statistics and Econometrics". As far
as I know this is the first computer implementation of part of it. The only
other implementation of matrix calculus that I know of is the on the [Matrix
Calculus](https://www.matrixcalculus.org) website, which supports everything I
do and more, but using a more sofisticated underlying formalism and it is not
opensource.
