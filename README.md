# Deriving "vector-Jacobian" products with matrix calculus

This repository contains my implementation of symbolic *matrix calculus*, in
particular the the special case of functions of matrix input and scalar output.

To understand why this family of functions is important consider the following
expression *G:F(X)* where *G* and *X* are matrices, *F* a function of matrix
value and *:* the Frobenius inner product. The derivative of that espression is
the "vector-Jacobian" needed by the back-propagation algorithm to make
the "gradient" pass through that function.

The matrix calculus used is the one by Magnus and Naudecker in "Matrix
Diï¬€erential Calculus with Applications in Statistics and Econometrics". As far
as I know this is the first computer implementation of part of it. The only
other implementation of matrix calculus that I know of is the on the [Matrix
Calculus](https://www.matrixcalculus.org) website, which supports everything I
do and more, but using a more sofisticated underlying formalism and it is not
opensource.

Below there is an example output from the program:
```
vJp> G:(A X+A X)
Steps for the derivation of
G:(A X+A X)
Equivalent expression to check result on https://www.matrixcalculus.org
tr(G'*(A*X+A*X))
Step 1. Differential application;
G:(A dX+A dX)
#operand=5 #operator=6 sum=11
Step 2. Distribution;
	G:A dX+G:A dX
	G:A dX+G:A dX
G:A dX+G:A dX
#operand=6 #operator=7 sum=13
Step 3. Bring out differentials;
	A' G+A' G
A' G+A' G
#operand=4 #operator=5 sum=9
Step 4. Accumulation;
2.I A' G
#operand=3 #operator=3 sum=6
Step 5. Factorization;
	2.I A' G
2.I A' G
#operand=3 #operator=3 sum=6
2.I A' G
```
